                               There are many asset classes of energy such as natural gas, oil and its derivatives. The oil is also referred to as Petro-dollar. When the condition of the dollar is weak, the oil prices go up almost immediately. In simple words, a weak dollar always results in oil prices going up. <br><br>

There are many countries that produce oil on a big scale. Some of these countries have control on supply of this element, and they even control the prices. They can enhance the availability of oil. At the same time, they can also limit the physical quantity of the oil. Energy trading is conducted every twenty-four hours, and it is a form of globalized trading. There are many traders who look for fast movements, and this makes energy trading an ideal instrument. There are many investors who search for energy CFDs.<br><br>

It is correctly said that oil is one of the most profitable trading options. WTI (West Texas Intermediate) is a key crude oil grade that is used for determining oil prices. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, the WTI contracts are sold. In case you want to know about the WTI’s historical price data, it can be collected from the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy. From the North Sea, the Brent Crude is derived. It is an integration of Oseberg, Ekofisk Crudes (BFOE Quotation), Brent Blend and Forties Blend. The trading average price is mentioned through an index and lasts for three weeks in the BFOE market. <br><br>

NGAS is the natural gas futures contract’s pricing point on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Please note that on ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) the OTC swaps are traded. At the Henry Hub, the future and spot prices are set, and they are denominated in millions of thermal units. In the North American natural gas market, it is considered as a primary price set.
